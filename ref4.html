<p>My reflection from the stress exercise is that everything that will be able to affect our daily routine from stress and exercise is something that may cause an effect from your diet this is an example of being to comply the situation of a person from their daily we can also that being a stressed person can lead to a follow up of many kind of diseases that may cause your body to weaken if you didn’t take care of yourself.
</p> 
<p>This is where the training or exercises can help you relieve from your stress and able to keep your body healthy and strong, the thinking of a human person is that more work means your tired and not well but that is not the case for the person who always have a daily routine exercise of exercise to help keep themselves focus daily.
</p> 
<p>Another thing about stress is that it only affect your mentality not the body itself but with proper care from yourself you can help yourself solve your daily problem and cleanse your inner thinking from any kind of task that you left on work and start to worry more about yourself because even if we are getting nothing we might still be able to keep our sanity into the brink of a healthy thinking.
</p> 
<p>So my last thought between stress and exercise is that exercise serve as a relief of duty from the hard work that you receive by the outside that you don’t even do when you are in a workplace and able to express you emotion through your daily routines and will actually help save yourself from any kind of diseases that will affect your daily lives because of stress and will always help you from that daily schedules
